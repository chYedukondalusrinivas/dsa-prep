# DSA Prep

This repository contains my daily Data Structures & Algorithms practice.
In this repo I will be following a DSA sheet and solve the problems.

## Goals
- Build strong problem-solving skills in Java.
- Learn and recognize common patterns (two pointers, sliding window, DP, etc.).
- Track my progress and thinking over time.

## Structure
- `leetcode/` – LeetCode solutions, organized by topic (arrays, stack, linked-list, etc.).
- `notes/` – Concept notes and patterns in my own words.

## Language
- Java
